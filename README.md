# FileService
The Online File Manager allows users to  easily add, view, edit, and delete files. It's designed to be available all the time and can handle more users when necessary. In the background, it has a robust setup: a backend driven by an API using Flask and a user-friendly front end using React JS. Also, I have leveraged AWS services like S3, S3 Transfer Acceleration, CloudFront, Lambda, EC2, ELB, AutoScaling Group, RDS, R53, cloudWatch and SNS
